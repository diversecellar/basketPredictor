## Project Background
The project is built since Septermber 2021, inorder to provide analysis for predicting scores in NBA basketball games for the sake of investment analysis and also, a status qou analysis of goings on in the sport. The code incorporates btoh web-scraping and dta processing, cleaning and analysis tools inorder to properly store data in local databases related via excel and version controlled by the working file system of the system architechture.
  
## Features
It is platform independent, thus all that is required is to have Python 3.9+, and the Python modules:
* **Data Analysis:** pandas, numPY, math, statsmodels and other built-in math packages
* **Text Gneration and Extraction:** re, unidecode
* **Web Scraping:** bs4, requests, html-table-parser
* **Active Directory and File Systems:** os, pathlib, shutil, glob

Languages used:
* Python
* HTML
* Excel VBA

Other features:
* Scrapes data by detecting tables of particular type
* Cleans and transforms data, that is utf-8 encoded
* Standardises all data formats and data values within a particular feature
* Processes timed queries to the web data front (basketball reference)
* Sustainable request methods using sleep timers
* Relates different data stores to one another in excel
* Utilises correlation theory, and stochastic prediction models for predicting scores
* Prints probability of outcomes, and confidence level (percentage)
